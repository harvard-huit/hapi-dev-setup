## Development Environemnt Setup

The following is guidance for the installation of software development tools. Of course, developers have personal preferences for setting up their environment. The main objective of this information is to provide help and give general guidance if you are having trouble with your environment setup.

The guidance is broken down between novice and experienced users. 

## Tools
* Git (Version Control System)
* Shell (Bash, Zsh)
* Text Editor
* Python

## Novice User

The best practice for software installation guides should consider user experience. The following developer tool installation requires no prior experience. [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) has prepared software [lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and a setup for beginning developers.

## Experienced Users 

The following is guidance for the setup of a developer environment. Of course, experienced developers can have personal preferences for setting up their own environment. Iâ€™m not saying this is the only or best way, but could be helpful.

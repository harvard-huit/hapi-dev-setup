# Linux



## Git

If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install git` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install git`.

## Shell

The default shell is usually Bash and there is usually no need to install anything.

To see if your default shell is Bash type `echo $SHELL` in a terminal and press the `Enter` key. If the message printed does not end with '/bash' then your default is something else and you can run Bash by typing `bash`.

## Text Editor

`Vim` and `Nano` should already be installed on most Linux distros.
